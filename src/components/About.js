          I have always had a love for entrepreneurship and technology. My post-secondary education is in Business Administration with a specialization in Small Business and Entrepreneurship and I have taken a coding Bootcamp to expand my current skill set in web development. 

My sales background is in various parts of the sales process, whether finding new business or increasing the share of wallet. When I am not working, I freelance to support small companies to create/ and improve their online presence.
